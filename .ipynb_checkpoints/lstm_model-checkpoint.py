# Compiling the RNN

# This code sets up a simple LSTM model using Keras for stock price prediction. You can further enhance this code by integrating it with a trading strategy and connecting it to a brokerage's API for executing trades based on the model's predictions.
# Please note that this is a basic example, and building a complete trading bot involves additional considerations such as risk management, backtesting, and live trading integration.
# For a more comprehensive implementation, you can refer to the following GitHub repository: Stock Market Prediction & Trading Bot using AI.
# Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions and adhere to regulatory requirements when implementing trading bots.
